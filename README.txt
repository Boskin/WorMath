WorMath version 1.0

Description: This is an Arduino game named WorMath. The rules of the game are very
similar to those of the popular game Snake. However, in order for one to grow
his or her snake, he or she must direct the snake toward the correct answer of
the simple arithmetic problem shown on the right of the screen. There are three
generated answers on the field. If the snake eats the correct one, it grows by 3
units. If it eats a wrong answer, it shrinks by 1 unit. The goal of the game is to
make the snake as long as possible.
